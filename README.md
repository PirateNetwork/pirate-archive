## Komodo Platform Technologies Integrated In PirateChain

- Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) - Additional security layer and Komodos own consensus algorithm  
- zk-SNARKs - Komodo Platform's privacy technology for shielded transactions  


## Tech Specification
- Max Supply: 200 million ARRR
- Block Time: 60s
- Block Reward: 256 ARRR
- Mining Algorithm: Equihash 200,9

## About this Project
PirateChain (ARRR) is a 100% private send cryptocurrency. It uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users activity on the network. Most privacy coins are riddled with holes created by optional privacy. PirateChain uses zk-SNARKs to shield 100% of the peer to peer transactions on the blockchain making for highly anonymous and private transactions.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

```shell
#The following packages are needed:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool libncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev ntp ntpdate nano software-properties-common curl libevent-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev cmake clang libsodium-dev -y
```

### Build Komodo

This software is based on zcash and considered experimental and is continously undergoing heavy development.

The dev branch is considered the bleeding edge codebase while the master-branch is considered tested (unit tests, runtime tests, functionality). At no point of time do the Komodo Platform developers take any responsbility for any damage out of the usage of this software. 
Komodo builds for all operating systems out of the same codebase. Follow the OS specific instructions from below.

#### Linux
```shell
git clone https://github.com/PirateNetwork/pirate --branch beta --single-branch
cd pirate
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use; -j$(nproc) for all threads available
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
# This can take some time.
```

#### OSX
Ensure you have [brew](https://brew.sh) and the command line tools installed (comes automatically with XCode) and run:
```shell
brew update && brew install gcc@6
git clone https://github.com/PirateNetwork/pirate --branch beta --single-branch
cd pirate
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use; -j$(nproc) for all threads available
./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```

#### Windows
Use a debian cross-compilation setup with mingw for windows and run:
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl cmake mingw-w64
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
git clone https://github.com/PirateNetwork/pirate --branch beta --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use; -j$(nproc) for all threads available
./zcutil/build-win.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```

To reset the PirateChain blockchain change into the *~/.komodo/PIRATE* data directory and delete the corresponding files by running `rm -rf blocks chainstate debug.log komodostate db.log` and restart daemon



**Pirate is based on Komodo which is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk.
